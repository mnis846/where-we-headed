    <h1> _Where We Headed..!</h1>

  <div class="firstpara">
    <p>We are living our world where everything is perfect i mean look around you everything is perfect that's why
 you exist in first place. There are many types of people living some of them are some educated some of
 them are uneducated. Most of them are living life to get money , to be successfull, to make a place in
 society etc, but few of them are the people who wants to understand or figure out what actually happening
 around us i think i am one of them.</p>

  <p>       This is not wikipedia or anything like facebook or somethiing like that i thought writing all this in any plateform
but it did'nt fit in any of them, So i thought i'll make my own webpage with help github pages and here i am.
I am not trying to build software like facebook but i wanna talk about it , technology has been devloped in
last few decades more than anything .I mean the speed  with technology has upgraded is more than anything
i guess for example speed of processing power of computers, mobile phones , tv's and manything.
The computer that calculated the data of apollo 11 had  32,768 bits of RAM memory, and  It had 2048 words
 of memory which could be used to store “temporary results” – data that is lost when there is no power.
and now see a mobile phone has RAM of atleast 4GB. Technology was meant to support mankind to move
forward but i feel most of them are stuck with it . You can't say that it is the mistake of social plateforms,
i think the phase of time we are going through is meant to be this, In current time us wants to earn money
somehow , it dosen't matter that how our way of earning money is affecting others life. Its just matter of time
when people will realise that money is not that important. In today's world we are extracting oil from earth,
cutting trees , digging holes in our planets , mankind madness is all over the world. Goverment is busy in
 maintaining peace, private education institutes are doing bussiness deals in the name of education,
man are fighting , Big comapany's are making plans to manipulate people in order to gain more profit .
All this is happning in the our world.
